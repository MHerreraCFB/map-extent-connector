# Map Extent Connector (Experience Builder Widget)

## Overview
The Map Extent Connector is a custom ArcGIS Experience Builder widget that
synchronizes map extents across multiple Map Widgets inside an Experience.

When a user changes views or navigates between sections, the widget restores
the last known map extent to maintain spatial continuity.

- Compatible with Experience Builder Developer Edition
- Production-safe build (`npm run build:prod`)

## Requirements

- Node.js (version matching ExB Dev requirements)
